## Test 01

### Question

groupthink

### Sample 

Groupthink is a process **by which** group may make bad or **irrational** decisions. In the professor's example he says that, years ago, 
he was working for a computer company. And one day, he and his co-worker suggested to give their computers a new look. At first half of the group supported their idea, but a few senior managers didn't agree with this idea. Almost immediately some of the supporters changed their mind including his coworker, because he didn't want to **leave a bad impression on** the senior managers which might also **jeopardize his promotion**. But **at last even** the professor himself **voted against** his own idea, and that **end up costing** the company a lot of money, because their **competitors** designed a new look, and they made a lot of money.
