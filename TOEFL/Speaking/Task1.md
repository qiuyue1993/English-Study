### Test 01

"Talk about a book you have read that was important to you for some reason. Explain why the book was important to you. Give specific
details and examples to explain your answer."

- Example answer 1

I would like to talk about a book called *How to make a Presentation*, because it has taught me an important skill of how to gain confidence. In the past, I was a horrible public speaker. I would stammer, and my mind would go blank automatically when I was standing in front of a large crowd. I felt so sad about it. Then my English teacher Jessica recommended this book to me. It really helps, telling you how to collect information from the Internet or the library to write a good speech and how to practice in front of the mirror to improve. I have tried these methods and practiced a lot. Right now I am quite a fluent public speaker.
