Sample 1: The most helpful book for me is the famous English novel "Jane Eyre" written by Charlotte Bronte. **The heroine called Jane Eyre is outwardly of poor appearance but plucky**, she poses great courage and **indomitable spirit** to battle against unfair fortune as the governess to the daughter of attractive Mr. Rochester. **That story happened on Jane does encourage people to challenge fate and take a positive and  independent attitude to fight for freedom and equality, thus allowing access to our own happiness.** That is also why I think this book, Jane Eyre, is so important to me.
