## Test 01

### Question

Campus sculpture.

### Sample

The student in the letter **proposes** that the university should not purchase a new sculpture for campus, **because of** the limited financial budgets **and also** the sculpture will **take up** the green space there. And the women totally disagrees with these two reasons, because firstly she thinks that there is an **anonymous** donor who will pay most of the bill for the sculputure. So this financial budgets thing is totally unconvincing. And she **believes that** it's a great thing to have some nice art on campus. Secondly she says that the student in the letter **aways plays soccer ball there with** his friends. And now if there's this new sculputure putting there, and he's gonna have to like move, and he doesn't want to move.
