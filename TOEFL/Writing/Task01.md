## Task01

### Test 01

**Question**: four-day workweek

**Sample response**:
The passage **argues that** four-day work week **will benefit** companies, the whole economy, and individuals. But in the lecture, the professor **holds a totally different view that** no one will **be beneficial from** the new work week.

Firstly, the passage says that companies **will** get more profits for **employees can work more effectively**. **However**, the lecture **points out** that four-day workweek will **lead to spending more**. **That is because** companies **have to** spend more money on training, **medical benefits**, office positions, even new computers.

Secondly, the passage **claims that** the whole economy will benefit, **for the four-day workweek is a way to reduce unemployment rates**. The lecture **refutes the idea completely**. Admittedly, there are more available jobs, but companies will **prefer to let** employees work overtime to finish them **for hiring new staff is too expensive**. In addition, the companies **may lift their expectation that staff finish** five-day jobs within four-day.

Thirdly, the passage **suggests that** individual employees can benefit from it. Though the four-day workweek can provide more leisure time to employees, the lecture **argues against** the passage. **Comparing to** five-day workers, the four-day workweek employees may be the first to one **to be fire** during **economic depression**. And they **will have less chance to promotion** because companies wish that managers **could be on duty** every work day.
